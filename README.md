### SIU Parking Assistant

This web app allows visitors parking in any paid parking locations on campus to pay for their parking on-the-go. The visitor can park their vehicle as they usually do, however instead of trying to remember their stall number and going to a pay station, they can simply open this web app on their phone and pay right then and there or on their way to work/class. This will help to prevent incorrectly inputted stall numbers, long lines at the pay stations, and time spent overall. The app would also allow the Parking Division to have an aerial overview of the parking lot, and see at a quick glance which stalls should be filled and paid for and which are open.
